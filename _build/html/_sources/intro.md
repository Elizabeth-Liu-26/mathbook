# Welcome to Mathbook

I'm glad you're here! 

There are many, many amazing math resources out there, but sometimes it can be a bit overwhelming to find and parse through them all. Mathbook is meant to be an initial landing page - your starting point to explore, asses what you know, and grow curiosity about the wonders of math. 

Topics are covered briefly and at a high-level, with pleny of practice problems to try and additional helpful resources linked throughout. If you think of your school textbook as the main course, consider this site a delicious appetizer - a fun intro, but not enough to fill you up all the way.

Mathbook is a passion project and labor of love after years of tutoring so many amazing students of math. I'm constantly adding new topics - and if you'd like to suggest something (or just say hi) please send an email to mathbook@gmail.com. 
I hope you find this site useful. Don't be shy to explore new topics, and above all remember: <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1em;"><i>Anyone and everyone can learn, love, and live the beauty of math.</i></span>
